    <h3>1. A file server in TCP</h3>

    <p>The source code of both client side and
      server side are downloadable; <a href="TCP_Client.c">TCP Client in C</a> and <a href="TCP_Server.c">TCP Server in
        C</a> for reference.
      Current client code displays the (text) file on the standard output. Modify
      client side so that a binrary file, transferred from the server, will be saved
      as a file in the local directory. Make both sides running on Unix computers (by remote access).
      Note that currently three servers are accessible, Blanca, Shavano and Windom.
      Since those Unix machines are sharing the same file system, you may create a
      new directory to save the received file at the client side. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

    <p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:12.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Server side:
        TCP_server<br>
        Client side: TCP_client server_hostname filename <br style='mso-special-character:
            line-break'>
        <![if !supportLineBreakNewLine]><br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>
        <![endif]>
        <o:p></o:p>
      </span></p>

    <p>TCP_client is the executable program. server_hostname
      is the hostname of the machine you use as the server (use windom). filename is
      the file that client wants to read from the server. We assume that the server
      has the requested file (you can store several PDF files there). Use the PDF
      file <a href="SIGCOMM14-Quartz.pdf">TEST FILE</a> to test your programs. You
      may use binary I/O in the file operations. You may also want to save the
      transmitted file in a different directory due to the use of a shared file system
      in our Unix computers (by remote access).
    <p>You should be able to open the test
      PDF file on the client machine after the TCP transmission is completed. Note
      that you may use 2XYZ as the port number in your program, in which XYZ are the
      last 3 digits of your student ID. Doing so would avoid that multiple programs/processes use the same port for
      communication. </p>

    <h3>2. A file server in UDP (with flow control)</h3>

    <p>Modify the source code of 3.1 using UDP sockets (instead of TCP sockets). Make both sides running on Unix
      computers
      (by remote access). See <a href="UDP_EchoClient.c">UDP Client in C</a> and <a href="UDP_EchoServer.c">UDP Server
        in
        C</a> for reference. Then, enhance the reliability of your code
      of 3.2(a) by implementing two ARQ algorithms; stop-and-wait (SW),
      and one of go back N (GBN) and selective repeat (SR).
      Refer to Chapter 3 of the book for sequencing, ACKs, and retransmission mechanisms.
      The communication should be reliable, assuring that the
      client got whole file correctly. Since UDP indeed is indeed quite reliable for
      communications within a LAN, use a random generator/function to "purposely" drop
      X% of data blocks BEFORE they are delivered from the server side.
      Each UDP segment should be less than 4KB, so that you can have enough segments to
      experience a few segment losses.
    </p>

    Server side: UDP_server loss_probability protocol_type

    Client side: UDP_client server_hostname file_name protocol_type

    Parameter loss_probability is the dropping probability (an integer) as a command-line input of the
    server code. Parameter protocol_type is the ARQ type implemented (1 for SW, 2 for GBN, 3 for SR).
    server_hostname is the hostname of the machine you use as the
    server (e.g., use WINDOM server). filename is the file that client wants to read from the
    server. Clearly, we assume that the server has the requested file. Use the PDF
    file <a href="PDDModel_Network99.pdf">TEST FILE</a> to test your programs. You
    should be able to open the test PDF file on the client machine.
    You may want to save the transmitted file in a different directory due to the use of a shared file system
    in our Unix/Unix computers.

    Again, you may
    use 2XYZ as the port number in your program, in which XYZ are the last 3 digits
    of your student ID. Doing so would avoid that multiple programs/processes use the same port for communication. </p>

    <h3>What to turn in:</h3>

    Each student will do the project(s) individually.

    For this project you will submit to Canvas with one ZIP file (in the name of proj_Yourlastnames) of all source code, together with a
    technical report specifying:
    <ol>
      <li>
        How to compile and execute your program;
      </li>
      <li>
        The self-testing results of your
        program and any important feature you want to specify (if your program does not work, please notify it
        clearly). Your program should print the trace of flow control for the lost frames (i.e., Seq#, ACK#,
        Retransmission#) into an output text file.
      </li>
      <li>
        Please also have the project report in a hardcopy at the project submission time. Make sure your code can work
        in Unix machines (by remote access). We may check your project during the class time by remotely accessing
        servers.</li>
    </ol>

    You
    may search the Internet for more helpful information on socket-based network
    programming.
