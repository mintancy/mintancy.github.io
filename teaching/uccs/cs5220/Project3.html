The following papers are related to proportional DiffServ provisioning in the Internet.</p>

A project team consists of two person. If you want to do it by your own, you need the approval from the instructor in
advance.

<p><b>Part 1: a queueing model.</b></p>

See <a href="CS522-MM1-p1.pdf">description</a> and an associated <a href="Project1a_TraceTest.zip">Trace ZIP</a> file.

<p><b>Part 2: simulation or implementation with evaluation of PDD algorithms.</b></p>

You need to simulate and evaluate the PDD algorithms: WTP and PAD, which are
described in paper no.3 (C. Dovrolis, D. Stiliadis, and P. Ramanathan).
The purpose is to get the key idea and validate the experimental data in
the corresponding paper. You can extend the part I to have multiple queues and simulate the packet scheduling
algorithms.
<P>
  Apache has a "Commons-Math" project that has several classes that
  can be used for generating various distributions using Java. If you want to do projects using Java, refer to
  http://commons.apache.org/math/.

<p class=MsoNormal>What to turn in:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For this part you should write a technical report specifying
  the simulation/implementation scheme, major data structures, performance
  evaluations(with figures), comparisons with the results in the paper 3, and the
  running problem(s) of the code, if any.
  You also need to specify the workload partition between you and your teammate (if applicable).
  Email me the report with the source code and
  all files of the simulator in a SINGLE ZIP FILE.
  Submit the report in the hardcopy in the class at the due time.
  If there is any question, please contact me. </p>

<p> Note that your project is not limited to the paper/scope above.
  You can come up with your own proposal, for example, from the papers you read.
  But you need to contact me for approval in advance (the proposed work may NOT be already used for other class).
  You may come up with your own idea that is close to the topic and is deemed worthy of being a project.
