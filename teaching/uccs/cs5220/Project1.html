    <H2>CS 5220 Project 1
  </B></h2> <BR>
  <p>
    Generally, a team consists of two teammates. In case a teammate is not available, you will do the project by your
    own.
    If you want to but not able to identify a teammate, send an email to xtan4@uccs.edu and your teammate (if there is
    one) might be assigned by the instructor.
    Doing the project by yourself is an option, but there is no extra credit.
  <p>
    The project is to practice what we studied in class.

        1. Hamming Method for Error Correction
      <p>
        1.1 Write a program in C/C++ that can convert a bit stream of a packet into a frame by using Hamming coding.
        The bit stream is the input parameter of the program. For example, given an input parameter as 1001000, the
        correct output of the frame is 00110010000.
        Input bit stream will have 1 to 64 bits.
      <p>Some self-testing examples are:
        <br>
        Input 1001000; output 00110010000
        <br>
        Input 1010101; output 11110100101
        <br>
        Input 11111111; output 111011101111
        <br>
      <p>1.2 Write a program in C/C++ that can correct a single-bit error of a frame by using Hamming coding and output
        the packet (raw data).
        The incoming frame is the input parameter of the program. The output is the bit stream of a packet.
        For example, given an input parameter as 00110010001 (the correct frame should actually be 00110010000),
        the output bit stream is 1001000. Input frame will have 3 to 71 bits.
      <p>Some self-testing examples are:
        <br>
        Input 00110010000; output 1001000
        <br>
        Input 00110010001; output 1001000
        <br>
        Input 11110100101; output 1010101
        <br>
        Input 111011101111; output 11111111
        <br>
        Input 11110000101; output 1010101
        <br>
      <p>2. CRC for Error Detection
      <p>
        Write a program in C/C++ that can convert a bit stream of a packet into a frame by using CRC.
        The bit stream is the first input parameter of the program, which will have 8 to 128 bits.
        The generator function is the second input parameter of the program, which will have 4 to 16 bits.
        For example, if the generator function is x^4 + x + 1, the second input will be 10011.
        The output should be the transmitted bit stream with its CRC checksum bits; see example in Figure 3-9
        in the textbook.
      <p>Some self-testing examples are:
        <br>Input = 10011101, generator 1001, output 10011101100.
        <br>Input = 1101011011, generator 10011, output 11010110111110.
        <br>Input = 10011101, generator 1001, output 10011101100.
      <p>
        <b>What to turn in</b>:
      <p>

        For this project you will email xtan4@uccs.edu one ZIP file (in the name of P1_Yourlastnames.zip) of all source
        code, together with
        a Readme in DOC or PDF specifying
      <p>1) teammates' name and email address;
      <p>2) how to compile and execute your code, and any important feature you want to specify;
      <p>3) the testing results of your program (if your program does not work based on self-testing examples above,
        please notify it clearly);
      <p>For the Hamming method 1.1, one testing input is 1101001100110101;
      <p>For the Hamming method 1.2, one testing input is 011110110011001110101.
      <p>For the CRC codinng, Input is 1101011011011100, generator 1101110111011101.
      <p>and (4) teammate evaluation data specifying the major sub-tasks of the project and the workload
        percentage distribution between you and your teammate(s). For the project, you will specify and itemize the
        major sub-tasks and each sub-task's workload percentage,
        and who accomplished each sub-task. And, Each teammate will
        specify his/her own evaulation data about his/her teammate(s)' workload in the project,
        say &quot;I did 50% of the work and my teammate did the other 50%; or I did 60%
        and my teammate did only 40%. If no specification, the default is 50%-50%.
        The data can be sent to xtan4@uccs.edu separately if preferred.
      <p>Note that your source code will be evaluated. The program will perform appropriate error handling.
        It will display some appropriate message if the users command fails in any way.
        Towards this end, document your code carefully.
        For example, use comments to indicate what the corresponding portions of the code do.
        You might be asked to give a quick demo on your laptop or ENG 101. Please also have the project report in a
        hardcopy at the demo time.

      <p>If any question, please ask by sending email to xtan4@uccs.edu.
