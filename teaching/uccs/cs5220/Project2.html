<p>3.1. A file server in TCP</p>

<p>The source code of both client side and
  server side are downloadable; <a href="TCP_Client.c">TCP Client in C</a> and <a href="TCP_Server.c">TCP Server in
    C</a> for reference.
  Current client code displays the (text) file on the standard output. Modify
  client side so that a binrary file, transferred from the server, will be saved
  as a file in the local directory. Make both sides running on Unix computers (by remote access).
  Note that currently three servers are accessible, Blanca, Shavano and Windom.
  Since those Unix machines are sharing the same file system, you may create a
  new directory to save the received file at the client side. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:12.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Server side:
    TCP_server<br>
    Client side: TCP_client server_hostname filename <br style='mso-special-character:
  line-break'>
    <![if !supportLineBreakNewLine]><br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>
    <![endif]>
    <o:p></o:p>
  </span></p>

<p>TCP_client is the executable program. server_hostname
  is the hostname of the machine you use as the server (use windom). filename is
  the file that client wants to read from the server. We assume that the server
  has the requested file (you can store several PDF files there). Use the PDF
  file <a href="SIGCOMM14-Quartz.pdf">TEST FILE</a> to test your programs. You
  may use binary I/O in the file operations. You may also want to save the
  transmitted file in a different directory due to the use of a shared file system
  in our Unix computers (by remote access).
<p>You should be able to open the test
  PDF file on the client machine after the TCP transmission is completed. Note
  that you may use 2XYZ as the port number in your program, in which XYZ are the
  last 3 digits of your student ID. Doing so would avoid that multiple programs/processes use the same port for
  communication. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>3.2. A file server in UDP (with flow control)</p>

<p>Modify the source code of 3.1 using UDP sockets (instead of TCP sockets). Make both sides running on Unix computers
  (by remote access). See <a href="UDP_EchoClient.c">UDP Client in C</a> and <a href="UDP_EchoServer.c">UDP Server in
    C</a> for reference. Then, enhance the reliability of your code
  of 3.2(a) by implementing two ARQ algorithms; stop-and-wait (SW),
  and one of go back N (GBN) and selective repeat (SR).
  Refer to Chapter 3 of the book for sequencing, ACKs, and retransmission mechanisms.
  The communication should be reliable, assuring that the
  client got whole file correctly. Since UDP indeed is indeed quite reliable for
  communications within a LAN, use a random generator/function to "purposely" drop
  X% of data blocks BEFORE they are delivered from the server side.
  Each UDP segment should be less than 4KB, so that you can have enough segments to
  experience a few segment losses.
  <o:p></o:p></span>
</p>

Server side: UDP_server loss_probability protocol_type

Client side: UDP_client server_hostname file_name protocol_type

Parameter loss_probability is the dropping probability (an integer) as a command-line input of the
server code. Parameter protocol_type is the ARQ type implemented (1 for SW, 2 for GBN, 3 for SR).
server_hostname is the hostname of the machine you use as the
server (e.g., use WINDOM server). filename is the file that client wants to read from the
server. Clearly, we assume that the server has the requested file. Use the PDF
file <a href="PDDModel_Network99.pdf">TEST FILE</a> to test your programs. You
should be able to open the test PDF file on the client machine.
You may want to save the transmitted file in a different directory due to the use of a shared file system
in our Unix/Unix computers.

Again, you may
use 2XYZ as the port number in your program, in which XYZ are the last 3 digits
of your student ID. Doing so would avoid that multiple programs/processes use the same port for communication. <o:p>

<h3>What to turn in:</h3>

<h3><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-weight:normal;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>
    Each student will do the project(s) individually.

    <h3><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-weight:normal;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>For
        this project you will email me at zbo@cs.uccs.edu one
        ZIP file (in the name of P2_Yourlastnames) of all source code, together with a
        technical report specifying 1) how to
        compile and execute your program; 2) the self-testing results of your program and
        any important feature you want to specify (if your program does not work,
        please notify it clearly). Your program should print the trace of flow control
        for the lost frames (i.e., Seq#, ACK#, Retransmission#) into an output text file.
        Please also have the project report in a hardcopy at the project submission time.
        Make sure your code can work in Unix machines (by remote access).
        We may check your project during the class time by remotely accessing servers.
